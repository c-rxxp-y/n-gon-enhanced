# n-gon-mods
making mods for the browser game n-gon (https://landgreen.github.io/n-gon/)

# to-do:
- more shotgun tech
- more sniper tech
- lifesteal tech

# ideas:
javelin-type weapon:
  uses energy to charge up a dash at mouse position (limited range)
- tech ideas: increase dash range, bigger javelin, explosion on tip of weapon, lifesteal?

zenith laser:
  an upgraded version of base-game laser, but to use/for it to work takes all components/tech (based on zenith sword from terraria)

# recent patch notes:
- added new gun: ****sniper****
- added new sniper tech: ****explosive hollow-points****
