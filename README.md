# n-gon-modds
making mods for the browser game n-gon (https://landgreen.github.io/n-gon/)

# to-do:
finish implementing laser tech into base of zenith laser

# ideas:
javelin-type weapon
  uses energy to charge up a dash at mouse position (limited range)
- tech ideas: increase dash range, bigger javelin, explosion on tip of weapon, lifesteal?

zenith laser
  an upgraded version of base-game laser, but to use/for it to work takes all components/tech (based on zenith sword from terraria)

# recent patch notes:
- fixed problems with testing mode lag
- construct mode works properly now
- removed sword/scythe guns and guntech
