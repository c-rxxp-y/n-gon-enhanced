# n-gon-modding
making mods for the browser game n-gon (https://landgreen.github.io/n-gon/)

# to-do:
figure out level-editor bugs
-   why isnt the editor playing the created level
-   make better movement controls
-   update to most recent n-gon build

# ideas:
javelin-type weapon
  uses energy to charge up a dash at mouse position (limited range)
- tech ideas: increase dash range, bigger javelin, explosion on tip of weapon, lifesteal?
